## What

This is a [Flex Plugin](https://www.twilio.com/docs/flex/developer/plugins) that allows the Agents of your Contact Center to transfer back the call to the IVR.

## Why?

We have all faced the scenario where we called a company, but talked with the wrong agent.

Maybe we wanted to talk to Sales, but the Service team picked the call up – probably because we selected the wrong option while in the IVR. To tackle the scenario, agents will typically say, “please call us again, and press 2-4-1 to get to the correct department”. 

This Plugin will provide a better customer experience by allowing an agent to transfer a customer to the exact menu in the IVR where they wanted to be.
